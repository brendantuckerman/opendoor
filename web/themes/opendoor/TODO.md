Principles:

- Accessibility above all else;

This means it should be a minimalist design. Colours need to be AAA only. 

- Simple - both code and knowledge needing to make it work
- Flexibility, in line with the above;

Should be mobile first. Will need to review mobile & Accessbility.  
For mobile-- touchscreen elements should be larger. Forms should have as little typing as possible. There are tools on iOS/ Android for converting to more accessbile iOS VoiceOver / Android TalkBack
